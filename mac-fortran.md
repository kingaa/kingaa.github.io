## Instructions for installing *gfortran* on MacOSX

### OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) users

Make sure you have `Xcode` installed.  This can be downloaded from the App Store or from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/.

Open a terminal window and execute
```
xcode-select --install
```

This should have the result of installing command-line versions of all the tools you'll need to compile C and FORTRAN code.
To test it, run the [installation and test scripts](./preparation.html).

If these still don't work, complaining about a lack of FORTRAN support, try installing `gfortran` as shown in the instructions below for older versions of the OS.

### OSX 10.9 and older

Make sure you have `Xcode` installed.  It is available at https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/.  You may need to follow the "Additional Tools" link to find an older version of `Xcode`.

The following is based on the [instructions given on the *R* website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools).

To install `gfortran` in your user space in such a way that it can be easily removed later, download and run the `mac-fortran.sh` script from the course website by opening a terminal and executing
```
curl -O http://kingaa.github.io/scripts/mac-fortran.sh
sh mac-fortran.sh
```
This will download and unpack a new version of `gfortran`, putting it into a new directory: `~/gfortran`.  It will also put a `Makevars` file into your `~/.R` directory so that `R` knows where to look when it wants `gfortran`.

If it works, you should be able to run the [installation and test scripts](./preparation.html).

### Location of **gfortran** binaries
