<h3>Non-changes in <span class="pkg">tao</span> version 1.1.1</h3>


<ul>
<li><p>	To know and yet think we do not know is the highest attainment;
not to know and yet think we do know is a disease. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>	It is simply by being pained at the thought of having this disease that we are preserved from it. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The sage has not the disease. 
He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it.
</p>
</li></ul>
