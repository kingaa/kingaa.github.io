title: pomp, an R package for statistical inference using partially observed Markov processes
---
<p><strong>pomp</strong> provides a very general realization of nonlinear partially-observed Markov processes (AKA nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems). These are a generalization of linear state-space and hidden Markov models to nonlinear, non-Gaussian processes in either discrete or continuous time. In <strong>pomp</strong>, one can implement a model by specifying its unobserved process and measurement components; the package uses these functions in algorithms to simulate, analyze, and fit the model to data.  The motivation, structure, and contents of the package are described, with examples, in a <i>Journal of Statistical Software</i> paper, <a target="_blank" href="./vignettes/pompjss.pdf">an updated version of which is provided on this site</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, <strong>pomp</strong> provides support for</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic particle filtering (AKA sequential importance sampling or sequential Monte Carlo),</li>

  <li>trajectory matching,</li>

  <li>the approximate Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo algorithm of Liu&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;West&nbsp;(2001),</li>

  <li>the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method of Andrieu et al.&nbsp;(2010),</li>

  <li>approximate Bayesian computation (ABC; Toni et al.&nbsp;2009) </li>

  <li>the iterated filtering method of Ionides,&nbsp;Breto,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;King&nbsp;(2006),</li>

  <li>the improved iterated filtering method (Ionides et al. 2015),</li>

  <li>probe-matching methods (e.g., Kendall et al. 1999, Wood et al. 2010)</li>

  <li>the nonlinear forecasting method of Ellner&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Kendall,and</li>

  <li>power-spectrum-matching methods of Reuman et al. (2006).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Future support for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned.
In particular, <strong>pomp</strong> is a platform upon which general inference algorithms for partially observed Markov processes can be implemented.
