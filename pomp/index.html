title: pomp, an R package for statistical inference using partially observed Markov processes
---
<p><strong>pomp</strong> provides a very general realization of nonlinear partially-observed Markov processes (AKA nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems). These are a generalization of the familiar state-space and hidden Markov models to nonlinear, non-Gaussian processes in either discrete or continuous time. In <strong>pomp</strong>, one can implement a model by specifying its unobserved process and measurement components; the package uses these functions in algorithms to simulate, analyze, and fit the model to data.</p>

<p>At the moment, support is provided for</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic particle filtering (AKA sequential importance sampling or sequential Monte Carlo),</li>

  <li>trajectory matching,</li>

  <li>the approximate Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo algorithm of Liu&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;West&nbsp;(2001),</li>

  <li>the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method of Andrieu et al.&nbsp;(2010),</li>

  <li>approximate Bayesian computation (ABC; Toni et al.&nbsp;2009) </li>

  <li>the iterated filtering method of Ionides,&nbsp;Breto,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;King&nbsp;(2006),</li>

  <li>probe-matching methods (e.g., Kendall et al. 1999)</li>

  <li>the nonlinear forecasting method of Ellner&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Kendall,and</li>

  <li>power-spectrum-matching methods of Reuman et al. (2006).</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple worked examples are provided in <a href="./vignettes.html">vignettes</a> and in the <code>examples</code> directory of the installed package.</p>

<p>Future support for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned.</p>

<p>Please let the developers know if you find <strong>pomp</strong> useful, if you publish results obtained using it, if you come up with improvements, find bugs, or have suggestions or feature requests!</p>

<p>The package is provided under the GPL. Contributions are welcome, as are comments, suggestions, feature requests, examples, and bug reports. Please send these to <code>kingaa at umich dot edu</code>. <strong>pomp</strong> is under active development: new features are being added and old features are being improved. Although the developers will make efforts to preserve backward compatibility, we cannot absolutely guarantee backward compatibility.
