<h2>Installation instructions</h2>

<h3>Development version</h3>

<p>
The development version is often several weeks ahead of the version on CRAN.
You can install it from the Github repository by executing the following in an <code>R</code> session:
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;pomp&quot;,repos=&quot;http://kingaa.github.io&quot;)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
It is also easy to install from source using the <code>devtools</code> package:
<pre><code>require(devtools)
install_github(&quot;kingaa/pomp&quot;)</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can download the source as a <a href="http://github.com/kingaa/pomp/tarball/master">tarball</a> 
or as a <a href="http://github.com/kingaa/pomp/zipball/master">zip file</a>.
Unpack the tarball or zipfile (thereby creating a directory named, say, <code>kingaa-pomp-xxxxxxx</code>) and build the package source by executing
<pre><code>R CMD build kingaa-pomp-xxxxxxx</code></pre>
Then install the package from the <code>R</code> command line:
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;pomp_X.X.X.X.tar.gz&quot;)</code></pre>
</p>


<h3>Stable version</h3>

<p>
Source and binaries for the <a target="_blank" href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=pomp">CRAN version are available here</a>.
</p>


<h3>Important note for Windows users</h3>

<p>
To make use of <code>pomp</code>'s facilities for accelerated computation using compiled C code, and to compile the package from source, you will need the ability to compile C code and dynamically link it into an <code>R</code> session.
For this reason, you must install the <code>Rtools</code> suite, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools">http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools</a>.
<code>Rtools</code> is needed <i>both</i> to compile and install the development version from source <i>and</i> to obtain full value from any version of the package.
</p>

<p>
When installing <code>Rtools</code>, it is sufficient to choose the "Package authoring installation" option.
Also during the installation, tick the "edit system PATH" box.
</p>

<p>
Installation of <code>pomp</code> from source on Windows has been tested with versions 3.2 and 3.3 of <code>Rtools</code> under <code>R</code> version 3.2.3.
</p>


<h3>Important note for Mac OS X users</h3>

<p>
To compile the package from source, and to be able to make use of its facilities for accelerated computation using compiled C code, you will need the ability to compile C code and dynamically link it into an <code>R</code> session.
These facilities are provided in the <code>Xcode</code> app, which is free and can be installed via the App Store or downloaded from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some users report that <code>gfortran</code> is not installed by default in all versions of <code>Xcode</code>.
For instructions on installing a suitable version of <code>gfortran</code> (and other libraries you may need), see <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools">http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools</a> for the R project's recommendations on development tools and libraries for Mac OS X.
Some more recent binaries of the GCC Fortran compiler (<code>gfortran</code>) are available <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS">on gcc.gnu.org</a>.
